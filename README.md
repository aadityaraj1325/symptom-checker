## 🩺 **Project Description**
The **AI-Powered Medical Prediction System** uses pre-trained machine learning models to predict the probability of various diseases based on user inputs such as age, glucose level, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more. It offers an interactive and intuitive interface powered by **Streamlit**. The system aims to enhance early disease detection and empower users with predictive insights.

### ✅ **Key Objectives:**
- Provide **fast and reliable disease predictions** using AI models.
- Ensure **data accuracy and precision** by leveraging real-world datasets.
- Offer an easy-to-use, responsive, and interactive interface.

## 🧠 **Model Training and Evaluation**
The project contains individual training scripts for each disease in the `model_train/` folder.  
You can retrain the models by running the corresponding Python scripts:

**Example: Retraining the Diabetes Model**
```
python model_train/train_diabetes_model.py
```

### ✅ **Trained Models**
The `.pkl` files in the `models/` folder contain the pre-trained models:
- `diabetes_model.pkl`
- `heart_disease_model.pkl`
- `lung_cancer_model.pkl`
- `kidney_disease_model.pkl`
- `liver_disease_model.pkl`
- `parkinsons_model.pkl`
- `breast_cancer_model.pkl`
